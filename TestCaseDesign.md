# Test Design

I have tried using a gherkin structure for the test design but I am not that familiar with it, so structure and naming might be a bit off ðŸ˜„.

I also left out some tests that would target specific components like the date picker or column editor, because I assume those components would have their own stories/features, since i saw them used across the app

## Clarifying Questions

1. What fields need to be included in the account details?
2. Should the navigation arrows at the bottom of the Balance Details page be displayed if user has only one account?
